 * This file adds a symlink for needed Symfony files and adds them to .gitignore
 */

/*
 * What needs to be symlinked?
 *
 * - The entire contents of the `web` directory.
 *
 * So what happens if a user want to overwrite a symlinked file?
 * They would need to go through the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Remove the file from the `.gitignore` file
 * 2. Remove the symlink
 * 3. Add a file of their own
 *
 * As this is a viable option, this needs to be taken into account when symlinking.
 * So... To be exact... For each file that is symlinked a check needs to be done
 * to make sure that:
 * A. No file is present
 * B. If there is, that it is a symlink
 * C. The symlink already points to the file that is to be symlinked.
 *
 * If it does, nothing needs to happen and if it doesn't, also nothing happens.
 * So if a file already exists. Skip it? Apparently. But then also skip adding
 * the file to the gitignore.
